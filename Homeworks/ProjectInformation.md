# APPM 5630 Final Project

- The project is due at the beginning of class on Friday April 28, 2023.  The last three days of class (April 28, May 1 and 3) will be used for presentations
- The project consists of a 10 minute presentation and a short paper. There is no strict length requirement for the paper, but aim for 4 to 6 pages (including figures). Paper lengths are a guideline, as I’m aware you can add figures, code, adjust white space and font to make it longer/shorter.
- If you really wanted to, you could write a longer, much more detailed paper and skip the presentation
- On Friday April 28, we will determine the presentation order. You must be ready to present that Friday in case you are chosen.
- You are encouraged to form groups; group sizes can be 1 (single person), 2 or 3. No larger please.
- By Wednesday April 26, email me to let me know your group, so I know how many groups there are; this will help me schedule the presentations.
- The project is 20% of your overall class grade. It cannot be dropped.
- Deliverables:
  - Written paper (typeset; Latex is suggested but not required), turned in via Canvas
  - 10 minute talk
  - Slides for the talk (turned in via Canvas)
- More details:
  - Class participation is extra important these days, as a sign of respect to your fellow students.  You lose 10% of your project grade if you do not attend any of these last 3 days (unless you have a valid reason and contacted me about it).
  - You also lose 10% of your project grade if you are not ready to present on the day when you're scheduled to speak.
## What is a valid project?
- The project can be theoretical or computational (or both)
- One option is a "traditional" class-project, where you investigate an idea, and/or run simulations or do derivations or proofs, and/or connect several different ideas (e.g., create new ideas, though the originality/impact obviously does not have to rise to the level of a journal publication);
- You're encouraged to pursue an area related to your research interests
- Specific journal articles are a good starting point
  - You can reproduce their results
  - You can compare several methods
  - You can apply a method to a new problem or area
  - You can tweak a method
  - You can redo theoretical derivations more clearly (or with more details)
  - You can do a "book-report style"”" analysis of a paper, critical evaluating it (think of it as a peer-review for an article)
- Your results do not have to be novel; you do not need to write a journal quality paper!
- You'll want to related your project to something you learned in the class (see Rubric #2)
- Non-convex problems are valid topics *sometimes*, since a lot of convex optimization is linked to non-convex optimization
  - e.g. non-linear programming (NLP) solvers are used for both convex optimization (to find a global minimizer) and non-convex optimization (to find a stationary point). So you project could be about a NLP algorithm
  - e.g. convex relaxations of non-convex problems
  - I would prefer that you do **not** do a project that is focused only on an inherently non-convex idea, e.g., combinatorial optimization. But you could tackle, for example, integer linear programming if your focus is on the convex relaxations used in a branch-and-bound method.
- When in doubt about whether a project idea is valid, you can always email the instructor and ask!
## Rubric
Because the type of report is a bit open-ended, the rubric below is necessarily a bit vague:
1. Valid/interesting project (25%), and point of project is clear. For example, for an independent investigation, the problem you are trying to solve is explained and motivated and non-trivial. For a book-report style project, presenting on a paper, you need some kind of thesis (e.g., “This paper shows the power of this approach...”) and not just a summary, and explain why you chose that paper. For reproducing the results of a paper (computationally or analytically by going through a proof in extra detail), explain why you chose the paper, and why you are interested in their results (are they amazing results? do you distrust them? do they nicely illustrate concepts from class)?

2. Relate the project to a concept from class (25%). **Your project must include a paragraph describing how it involves concepts learned in class.**

3. Insightful discussion (25%). You should discuss/analyze your results, and/or validate a conclusion. For a paper review, you should discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the paper. For a project that involves generating your own results, the quality of the actual work is included in this category.

4. Professional communication (25%) of the written document and the oral presentation (and the slides). Well-organized and precise communication, grammatically correct writing, nicely format- ted documents and figures. Figures should be labeled appropriately.

Here is a [more detailed rubric](ProjectRubric.pdf) that I will actually use for grading the projects.
