# Class-specific policies

Advanced Convex Optimization, APPM 5630. University of Colorado Boulder, Spring 2023.

[Canvas link](https://canvas.colorado.edu/) (via SSO)

## Details in a nutshell
This class is expected to meet **in person**.  Lectures will usually be at a blackboard, with occasional computer demos. There will be homework and a project but no exams. Homework will involve theory and programming.  We'll use both this github website and Canvas (and Piazza).

## Instructor and contact Information

- The instructor is [Stephen Becker](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/becker/), Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics
- Contact him at <stephen.becker@colorado.edu>
- Jacob Spainhour, a PhD student in Applied Math, is the grader / TA.  He might hold limited office hours.

## Meeting times
Meeting time: MWF 10:10 -- 11:00 AM, in VAC 1B88

## Office Hours
Prof. Becker's office hours:
- These will likely be hybrid style, unless we determine that it really doesn't work well
- The physical location is ECOT 338 (engineering center, office tower, 3rd floor)
- The zoom link is available on Canvas

Times/dates:
- TBD


## Course Topic Information and Syllabus
See the separate [syllabus document](syllabus.md).

## Estimated Workload
This is intended to have a normal workload for an elective course, lower than the workload for a core course

## Prereqs
APPM 3310 “Matrix Methods” or similar; but APPM 4440 “Real Analysis” or equivalent (e.g., APPM 5440) is suggested. A first-course on optimization like CSCI 5254 “Convex Optimization” is helpful but not necessary.

## Textbook
See the separate [syllabus document](syllabus.md).

## Recitations
There are no recitations

## Exams
There are no exams

## Projects

There is one project, worth 20% of your grade. The last few weeks, there will be no/less homework and instead there is a final project, which is open-ended. Students are encouraged to form groups (up to three people). It can be either theory or computation. Topics should be discussed with the instructor. The final week, groups will give brief (about 10 min) presentations on their topic.

## Homeworks

There will be bi-weekly double-homeworks, consistent of two parts (theory and programming), so we count this as two homeworks.  You are allowed to drop two single homeworks (this will be done automatically), meaning either one double-homework or mix-and-match.

Homeworks will be turned in via **gradescope** (link to be provided via the Canvas assigment)

## Grading
- 80% Homework.
  - Late homework is not accepted, but you are allowed two free "dropped" homeworks. Your lowest-scoring homeworks will be automatically dropped. See the note below for caveats regarding "A".
  - i.e., you can drop one double homework, or two halves of any double homeworks
- 20% Project

The overall grade may be **curved** as appropriate (not guaranteed), but note that there is no set "quota" of A's, B's, etc., so you are not directly competing with your classmates.

**Note**: To get a grade of "A", you **cannot drop any homeworks**.  If you have to drop a homework, then the highest grade you can get is "A-".  (There are no "A+" grades at CU)

## Late assignment and cheating policy

In general, **late homework** assignments are not accepted; instead, you can use your two dropped homeworks.  Under exceptional circumstances (such as serious illness, including COVID-19, or serious family issues), homework can be turned in late.  If the reason is foreseeable (e.g., planned travel), you must contact the instructor in advance.

Examples:
- Your sister is getting married and you have to travel out-of-state.  That's great, but this is when you use the one dropped homework. This is foreseeable, and not an "emergency", so it does not count as an exceptional circumstance.
- A close family member becomes infected with COVID-19 and you have to return to your home country to take care of family.  This *does* count as an exceptional circumstance. Please email the instructor to discuss arrangements.

**Cheating** is not acceptable.  Take-home exams and homeworks are easy to cheat on if you really want to, but as this is an upper-division course, I am relying on the fact that students are here to learn (and paying the university to do so), and thus cheating does not make sense.  Cheating does not hurt the instructor, it hurts the student (and hurts the grades of honest classmates).

If a student is caught cheating, on the first occurrence, the penalty ranges from losing points on the item in question (like one test problem; this is for very minor infractions) to losing all points for the assignment (i.e., the entire homework or entire exam). Students may be referred to the honor council. On the second occurrence of cheating, similar penalties may apply, and additionally the student may fail the class, at the instructor's discretion.

"Minor infractions" include not following the instructions during an exam (in person or remote). For example, if the instructions on a remote test are to keep your microphone on and your hands in sight of your webcam, then failing to follow these instructions construes a minor infraction, and (even though cheating may not be proven) you are subject to losing points.

On homeworks, you are free to **collaborate** with other students, and to use resources like the internet appropriately. However, you must do your own work. There is a gray area between collaboration and cheating, and we rely on the students' and instructors discretion.  Copying code verbatim is never permissible.  You should be writing up your own work, and explaining answers in your own words.  Snippets of code are allowed to be similar (sometimes there is only one good way to do it), but longer chunks of code should never be identical.  If not expressly forbidden by the assignment, you may use the internet, but you may never post for help on online forums.  (Regarding forums, please use our Piazza website if you want a Q&A forum).

Cheating is not usually an issue in this class, and I have faith that students will continue to act appropriately.



## Course website

We will use [github](https://github.com/stephenbeckr/convex-optimization-class) for public content (notes, demos, syllabus), and use CU's default LMT **Canvas** for private content like grades and homework solutions.  Canvas will also be used to organize things like comments made via **gradescope**.  We also have a class website on **piazza** for Q&A; see Canvas for the link.

## Notes
When the class meets remotely, handwritten notes will be posted to the github website. When the class meets in person, notes will probably **not** be posted.

In Fall 2018, Mitchell Krock started some [typed notes](https://github.com/stephenbeckr/convex-optimization-class/tree/master/TypedNotes) that are hosted on our github website; you are free to use these. You can also add to them; just make a pull request on github, or if you want to make a lot of changes, ask to be added as a collaborator on github.  In Spring 2021, Jaden Wang added his version of typed notes too (see the `lecture_notes_tex` subfolder in the `TypedNotes` folder).



## Online behavior
As of the beginning of the semester, we do not anticipate teaching this class online.  However, if we later transition to online teaching due to COVID-19 or other reason, the following expectations hold:

On zoom, please have your webcam on if at all possible
- Valid reasons for not having the camera on: to protect the privacy of your family or roommate, if you cannot have a virtual background
- Invalid reason: you don't feel like it, or you didn't wash your hair.

We have the same standards of behavior as we would in a classroom: appropriate attire, appropriate and not distracting virtual backgrounds, verbal and chat remarks should be respectful, etc.  Real-world backgrounds should be appropriate and professional (please, no drugs or alcohol behind you).

It's always important to have respectful remarks, and even more so in an online setting, since it is easier to get carried away with chat comments since you cannot see the effect on other people.

If we enable private chat on zoom, remember that the zoom host can later see even "private" chats. Inappropriate or inconsiderate remarks, even on private chats, are not allowed.


## Dropping the Course
Advice from your department advisor is recommended before dropping any course. After 11:59 PM Wed Feb. 1, dropping a course results in a "W" on your transcript and you’ll be billed for tuition. After 11:59 PM Fri Mar. 24, dropping the course is possible only with a petition approved by the Dean’s office.  [The last day to **add** a class is Wed Jan 25 at 11:59 PM].

Note that due to COVID-19, these requirements or dates may change.
