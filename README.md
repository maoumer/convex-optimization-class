# Advanced Convex Optimization class
APPM 5630 at CU Boulder
Prof. Becker, Spring 2021. Meeting time: MWF 10:20 -- 11:10 AM, ECCR 265 (NOT in ECCR 1B40 anymore).  COVID-19 details: this class is currently scheduled to meet remotely in January but might meet **in person** starting mid-February depending on COVID-19 status.

Office hours:
- For weeks in which HW is due, office hours are 11:15 AM - 12:15 PM Wednesday (right after class), 3-5 PM Thursday, and 1-2 PM Friday.
- For all other weeks, office hours are only 3-5 PM Thursday.

This repo contains in-class demos and some homework solutions (much of it is from Fall 2018 when this class was taught as a special topics course 4720/5720)

- Here is the [class policy/procedures](policies.md) document (and if you need it for some reason, the [2018 policies/syllabus (PDF)](APPM4720_5720_Fall2018_Syllabus.pdf)).
- Here is the [syllabus (details on the content)](syllabus.md) document (and if you need it, the [day-by-day schedule](Fall2018_day-by-day_schedule.pdf) from Fall 2018 has even more details on what we covered)

Here is a list of [2018 class project topics](SlideshowAllPresentations_4720Fall18.pdf) in a nice PDF, as well as [2017 class projects](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/becker/SlideshowAllPresentations_4720Spr17.pdf).  

We will follow instructors' notes. The supplementary texts we used most often:
- [Convex Optimization by Boyd and Vandenberghe](http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/), Cambridge University Press 2004
- [First-Order Methods in Optimization by Amir Beck](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611974997), SIAM 2017, see also [SIAM website](http://bookstore.siam.org/mo25/)
- [Convex Analysis and Monotone Operator Theory in Hilbert Spaces by Bauschke and Combettes](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-48311-5), 2nd edition, Springer 2017
