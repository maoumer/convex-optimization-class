# APPM 5630 at CU Boulder: typed up notes


These are latex notes from the Fall 2018 class typed up by Mitchell Krock.

For future semesters, these notes might be modified/added/corrected (you can make a pull request if you have a change, or if you want to be very active, we can add you on the repo)

Note: the compiled pdf might not always be up-to-date

In addition, a less concise version of lecture notes for Spring 2021 will be updated regularly via master.pdf by Jaden. It is most useful for lectures not posted on github and ease of locating information in a single PDF, although occasional extra insights might be helpful. Source files will be shared at the end of the summer for convenience.
